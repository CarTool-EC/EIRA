Example: The following implementation is an example on how this specific Architecture Building Block (ABB) can be instantiated as a Solution Building Block (SBB): Activiti - Activiti is an open-source workflow engine written in Java that can execute business processes described in BPMN 2.0. Activiti supports open standards such as BPMN and DMN with open REST APIs for demanding human- and system-centric processes. It provides business intelligence and audit logs features for free. And with building the solution on business processes, Activiti help to structure the software, think about user tasks, external systems and timers that need to be managed, think about transaction boundaries of the application. Building that kind of features becomes easier when structuring an application around a business process. Managing wait states, timers and asynchronous continuations becomes easier. A business process can express that structure more compact than working with the fundamental instruments that the Java platform offers like JDBC and JMS. Activiti also makes possible to link in Java or scripting for jobs. https://www.activiti.org/

IoP Dimension: Structural IoP

LOST view: Technical view - application

Interoperability saliency: The Orchestration Component ABB &#160;is salient for technical interoperability because it provides a set of various methods to manage existing business processes or define and establish new ones. BPM components also execute business process documented through accepted modelling techniques, as recommended by the EIF n.28: "Document your business processes using commonly accepted modelling techniques and agree on how these processes should be aligned to deliver a European public service."
